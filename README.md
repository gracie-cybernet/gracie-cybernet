## 🎓 Academic Projects

### Global Tech Inc. – Multi-Site Network Design
> Designed a dual-site enterprise network in Cisco Packet Tracer using **RIP v2**, inter-VLAN routing via **multilayer switches**, and dual-ISP **failover**. Secured the setup using **SSH**, **ACLs**, and **wireless VLANs**.

### Traction Solutions – Centralized Network Integration
> Built a four-branch network integrating **VLANs**, centralized **DHCP**, and **RIP v2** routing. Deployed **QoS** for bandwidth-sensitive services and implemented secure, segmented wireless access across departments.

### MediCare Solutions – Secure Enterprise Architecture
> Architected a segmented healthcare network with **NAT**, **PAT**, and **ACLs**. Applied **DHCP Snooping**, **Dynamic ARP Inspection**, and **Port Security** to protect sensitive medical data in VLAN-separated departments.

### Windows Server Administration – Virtual Lab
> Simulated an enterprise environment using **Windows Server 2019** on **VirtualBox**. Configured **Active Directory**, **DNS**, **DHCP**, and **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to enforce security and streamline access control.
